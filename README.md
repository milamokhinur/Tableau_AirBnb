This project involves leveraging open Airbnb data for analysis and insights. Initially, I employed Tableau's Join feature to merge two datasets, enhancing the depth of information for the project. Using the combined data, I created visualizations in Tableau to provide valuable insights for individuals interested in investing in housing assets for Airbnb business.

In summary, the first table illustrates the revenue potential of different types of Airbnb-listed houses, highlighting that 6-bedroom houses can yield the highest revenue. However, a closer look at booking numbers reveals that 1-bedroom houses are consistently booked throughout the year. This suggests that investing in multiple 1-bedroom apartments may be more profitable in the broader context.

The analysis extends to the geographical aspect of investment, represented by a heatmap showing revenue generated by zip codes. Additionally, a table displays the average prices of listed apartments throughout the year, categorized by their respective zip codes. This information aids in determining strategic locations for property acquisition.

The final element addresses the timing of investments and Airbnb listings. A line graph illustrates revenue trends over the months, indicating that June and July are optimal periods to list apartments for Airbnb, resulting in higher accumulated revenues.

In essence, this data visualization project offers comprehensive insights for potential investors in the Airbnb housing market, encompassing property types, location considerations, and strategic timing for maximum profitability.
